# Home Assistant - eCabinet
This repository contains all the necessary files to integrate the project eCabinet with Home Assistant. This repository is part of school project in 4INFO at INSA Rennes. 

## Project description
The connected cabinet (or eCabinet) aims to help people, particularly those suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, by enabling them to easily locate products using LEDs and a voice assistant interface, and to ensure that objects are then properly stored thanks to RFID technology. The project aims to help people organize their closet space. 

## TODO
